# Data Collective

**UPDATE 2025-10-24** Data Collective has become the DataHub Collective and moved to https://github.com/datasets/collective.

The DataHub Collective is, in the broadest sense, a home for people who care about maintaining, publishing, and curating high-quality open datasets -- and developing and discussing the tools that support this.

More specifically, it’s a community of people maintaining the DataHub Commons of shared datasets, publishing material on DataHub.io, and contributing to the tooling around it.

One way to think of it as a more open, collective, and DataHub–oriented version of Our World in Data — a collaborative ecosystem for open data publishing and infrastructure.
